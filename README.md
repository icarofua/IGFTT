IGFTT features is open source and you can use that freely even in commercial applications. The code is released under BSD license. IGFTT which tackles the classic Computer Vision problem of detecting image keypoints for cases without a priori knowledge on the scene, camera poses and transformation. Compared to well-established algorithms with proven high performance, such as SIFT and SURF, the method at hand offers a dramatically faster alternative at comparable precision performance - a statement which we base on an extensive evaluation using an established framework.
